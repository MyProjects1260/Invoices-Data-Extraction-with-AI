# Invoices-Data-Extraction-with-AI

I used NER to extract informations from 7 different types of invoices

Steps : 

-Collect invoices

-Convert Pdf invoices to .txt

-Textprocessing for data cleaning 

-Annotate the data with Doccano for Named Entity Recognition

-Convert .json files to .spacy

-Train the model in CLI with spacy

-Evaluate & Test the model

-Store the result in a json file

-Create a simple web application with Flask
